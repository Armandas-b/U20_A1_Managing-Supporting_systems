A mock-up of the management and support infrastructure which includes:

- Network code of practice
- Support request and escalation procedures
- contingency plan
- user support documentation
- security policy, access control and traffic management expectations
- user desktop interface
- backup procedures

## Planning

Using task management tool ('Click Up') I have created a list of tasks that need to be completed in order to set up the infrastructure. The tasks are listed below as a Gantt chart:

![Task List](img/TaskList.PNG)

Each task progress can be documented inside, also the tasks can be assigned a status and a priority.
I decided to go with these Statues:

- Mockup - The task is not yet started/ or is being written up as a draft
- Implementation - The task is being worked on and implemented.
- Complete - The task is completed.

## **Managing and Supporting Systems documentation**

## Network code of practice

The network code of practice is a document that outlines the rules and regulations of the network. It is important to have this document as it will help to keep the network secure and running smoothly.

## Network and System requirements

System and network requirements are critical considerations when deploying software or applications within a business organization. In order to ensure optimal performance and avoid any technical difficulties, it's important to have the appropriate hardware and software specifications in place.

For a business organization that requires 30 computers and printers, it's recommended to have at least one server to manage the network and data storage. The server should meet the following specifications:

Processor: A modern multi-core processor with clock speeds of 2 GHz or higher.
Memory (RAM): At least 8 GB of RAM or higher, depending on the number of users and applications that will be running on the server.
Storage: Sufficient storage capacity to accommodate the organization's data needs. For example, 1 TB or more of hard disk space may be required.
Operating system: A server operating system such as Windows Server or Linux that is compatible with the organization's applications and network infrastructure.

For the 30 computers, the minimum system requirements should be as follows:

Processor: A modern multi-core processor with clock speeds of 2 GHz or higher.
Memory (RAM): At least 4 GB of RAM or higher, depending on the applications that will be used.
Storage: At least 500 GB of hard disk space or more, depending on the amount of data that will be stored locally.
Operating system: A modern operating system such as Windows 10 or macOS that is compatible with the organization's applications.
The printers should be network-enabled and compatible with the organization's network protocols. It's recommended to choose printers with high-capacity ink or toner cartridges to minimize the need for frequent replacements.

In terms of network requirements, the organization should have the following:

Sufficient bandwidth to accommodate the number of users and data transfer needs.
Low latency to ensure smooth communication between the computers, printers, and server.
Adequate security measures, such as firewalls and anti-virus software, to protect against potential cyber threats.
Overall, having the appropriate system and network requirements in place can help ensure that the business runs smoothly and efficiently. It's important to consult with IT professionals to ensure that the organization's hardware and software infrastructure is optimized for the business's specific needs.
